            Life is wild. Not really sure what to make of starting over but trying to make the most of my privilege and opportunity.
            If nothing else, at least I get to practice creating something new and for that I am gracious.
        </p>

            This webpage is nothing right now and maybe it will stay like that for a while. A rock in the corner of my repository. 
            Maybe in 10 years it'll be more laid out. What I want the most is to pay myself dividends and write every day. There are so
            many thoughts I'd like to share. Most of those thoughts stay imaginary. Making a blog let's me reference past thoughts and ideas that
            I've shelved. This projects makes me hold myself accountable to make my ideas real.  
        </p>
        <p>Going back to school for computer science is scary. Starting over is scary. Feeling like nothing in this system is demoralizing. Since
            I have nothing else to lose, I should have taken the leap and risk years ago. For myself and not what others think.
        </p>
        <p>I've seen various videos of others taking the leap of faith and figuring it out. Quitting their 9-5 and finding what fulfills them. Like many
            I want to be fulfilled. So cheers to a starting over, build-outs, and waking up everyday to build something.
        </p>
        <p>p.s. Thank you to the wonderful people of The Odin Project for jump starting this mindset.</p>
